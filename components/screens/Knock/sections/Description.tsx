          KNOCK is the last plugin you will ever need to make your drums slap
          and punch through your mix. This plugin was meticulously crafted by
          platinum producer & award winning sound designer, DECAP. It is
          inspired by the signature sound of his popular drum kit series DRUMS
          THAT KNOCK, which has helped shaped the sonics of modern music.
