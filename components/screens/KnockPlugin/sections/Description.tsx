				KNOCK is the last plugin you will ever need to make your drums slap and
				punch through your mix. This plugin was meticulously crafted by platinum
				producer & award winning sound designer, DECAP. It is inspired by the
				signature sound of his popular drum kit series DRUMS THAT KNOCK, which
				has helped shaped the sonics of modern music.
